Testing the Rainbow - A Skittles Experiment 

The use of a Pearsons Chi-square Goodness of Fit test for count data to determine whether a claim made by the Wrigley Jr. Company
circa 2002, in which the company proclaimed that each of its 2.17 oz original (red) bag of Skittles had an approximately 
equal distribution of Skittle colors still held true with significance. This was term project was for an introduction to 
computational statistics course (STA 4102) that I took during the Fall 2014 semester while attending the University of South
Florida for my undergraduate degree. During this time, the highest level of statistical coursework that I had taken was an 
introductory statistics course (STA 2023).
